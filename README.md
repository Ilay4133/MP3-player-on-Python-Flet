# MP3-player-on-Python-Flet
My project is a website with an mp3 player in Python and Flet. In which initially there is nothing and you need to add your own tracks to the site, make your own playlists. You listen to exactly the tracks you like, and you can also install desktop applications on your computer (I might do it).
